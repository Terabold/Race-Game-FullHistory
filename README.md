Race against the clock ⏱️ to complete the track as quickly as possible. Avoid obstacles 🛑 and stay within the track’s boundaries. Aim to beat your best time!

### <span style="color: #e74c3c;">1v1 Mode</span>
Challenge a friend 🏎️💨 on the same PC. Race head-to-head on the same track and see who reaches the finish line first! Be careful—colliding with obstacles will slow you down, and hitting the track's edges will end your race!
